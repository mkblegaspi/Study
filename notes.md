# Learn Advanced Modern C++

## Section 1: Introduction

### Introduction to the course

#### Modern C++

- Traditional C++:  
  - Arrays, pointers, inheritance
  - C with classes

- Modern C++ began with C++11**  

- Substantial revision, with lots of new features and improvements  
  - "It feels like anew language" - Bjarne Stroustrup

#### Advantages of Modern C++

- Safer  
  - Safer alternatives to C features - explicit pointers, built-in arrays
- Compiler-generated loops
  - No need for programmers to manage memory

- More expressive  
  - Local functions make containers and algorithm functions work better together
  - Better abstractions reduce the amount of "boilerplate" code

- More efficient  
  - More work can be done at compile time
  - Avoid making copies  of transient data

#### Benefits of Modern C++

- Less low-level code to write and test
  - Quicker development

- Clearer and more expressive code
  - Easier to maintain

- Code more likely to be correct and efficient
  - Fewer defect reports and performance issues

- Avoid many situations which cause undefined behaviour
  - Fewer crashes
  - Less debugging
